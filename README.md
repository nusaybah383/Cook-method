# Cook's distance
It is named after the American statistician R. Dennis Cook, who introduced the concept in 1977
In statistics, Cook's distance or Cook's D is a commonly used estimate of the influence of a data point when performing a least-squares regression analysis. In an ordinary least squares analysis, Cook's distance can be used in several ways: to indicate influential data points that are particularly worth checking for validity or to indicate regions of the design space where it would be good to be able to obtain more data points.
Cook's distance is the scaled change in fitted values, which is useful for identifying outliers in the X values (observations for predictor variables). 
Cook's distance shows the influence of each observation on the fitted response values.
